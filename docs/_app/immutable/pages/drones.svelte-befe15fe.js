Was bored sitting around, bought to get me up and moving. What a wonderful, fun device for an old pilot that cannot fly anymore. I highly recommend for any beginner to drones.",review3:"I got this and it's so much fun. The whole family think it's really cool and always ask to play with it. Claims to be for kids but I feel its good for any adult as well. Very nice product.",review4:"I\u2019ve had multiple indoor drones and they\u2019ve all been terrible. I spend more time adjusting the trim than flying the things and they still are nearly impossible to fly. The tello is the opposite. Open the box, charge it, connect the iPad, and off you go. Sure, there is a tiny learning curve, but generally it is so easy that my 7 year old can safely navigate it.
