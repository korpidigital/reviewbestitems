                <div class="details"><ul><li>Equipped with a high-quality image processor, the Tello drone shoots incredible photos and videos. Even if you don’t know how to fly, you can record pro-level videos with EZ Shots and share them on social media from your smartphone.</li>
                        <li>Camera features 5MP (2592x1936) photos and HD720 video</li>
                        <li>Tello has two antennas that make video transmission extra stable and a high-capacity battery that offers impressively long flight times.</li>

                <div class="details"><ul><blockquote class="svelte-1ls0fyj"><li>This is the most fun and stable drone for beginners. I’m a beginner and have flown a small amount of drones. This little Tello is exactly what I was looking. Buy it and you will be happy.</li></blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="svelte-1ls0fyj"><li>Never thought this item would be so much fun. Was bored sitting around, bought to get me up and moving. What a wonderful, fun device for an old pilot that cannot fly anymore. I highly recommend for any beginner to drones.</li></blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="svelte-1ls0fyj"><li>I got this and it&#39;s so much fun. The whole family think it&#39;s really cool and always ask to play with it. Claims to be for kids but I feel its good for any adult as well. Very nice product.</li></blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="svelte-1ls0fyj"><li>I’ve had multiple indoor drones and they’ve all been terrible. I spend more time adjusting the trim than flying the things and they still are nearly impossible to fly. The tello is the opposite. Open the box, charge it, connect the iPad, and off you go. Sure, there is a tiny learning curve, but generally it is so easy that my 7 year old can safely navigate it. If you’re looking for a beginner drone, don’t bother with the cheap ones, get the Tello!</li></blockquote></ul>

Super happy with this purchase.</li></blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="svelte-1ls0fyj"><li>I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter for Christmas.
